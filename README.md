PRFect takes as input the genome and its annotated CoDing Sequences (CDS) as a GenBank file.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp; *If you only have a fasta file we recommend our brand new gene caller [Genotate](https://github.com/deprekate/genotate) that is* <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *the only gene caller that can call gene fragments*

PRFect searches through a GenBank file looking for 8 different slippery site motifs associated with
backwards (-1) frameshifts and two motifs associated with forward (+1) frameshifts. When
a motif is encountered, various cellular properties and factors are assessed and
a prediction is made whether the site is involved in programmed ribosomal frameshifting.

An example genome for SARS-Cov2 is provided in the test folder. The SARS-Cov2 genome contains 12 genes the first of which happens to be a PRF gene and is denoted as such through the use of the `join` keyword.  Any genes already present that use the `join` keyword are split into their two parts and subsequently predicted anew and then tagged with the /label=1 feature tag to indicate a TruePositive.  When the genome is run through PRFect the known PRF gene is correctly predicted to utilize programmed ribosomal frameshifting.

```
$ prfect.py test/covid19.gbk 

     CDS             join(266..13468,13468..21555)
                     /ribosomal_slippage
                     /direction=-1
                     /motif=is_threethree
                     /slippery_sequence=tttaaac
                     /label=1
                     /locus=NC_045512
                     /product="ORF1ab polyprotein"
                     /product="ORF1ab polyprotein"

```

Another example is bacteriophage lambda, which has the *geneG* and *geneGT* tail assembly chaperone gene that is known to frameshift.  The current genbank annotation file (NC_001416) does not have the gene properly denoted with the `join` keyword and so both pieces are in two separate CDS features.  When the genome is run through PRFect the gene is correctly identified as being a single PRF gene with the /label=0 to indicate that it is an UnknownPositive.

```
$ prfect.py test/lambda.gbk

     CDS             join(9711..10115,10115..10549)
                     /ribosomal_slippage
                     /direction=-1
                     /motif=is_threethree
                     /bases=gggaaag
                     /label=0
                     /locus=NC_001416
                     /product="minor tail protein G"
                     /product="tail assembly protein T"
```


You can show all the slippery sites that PRFect checked to make sure it evaluated a given site and to see if there were any near hits.
Using the `--dump` flag will show the calculated cellular properites at each potential slippery site:
```

You can even use the flag `-s` to scale the MFE calculations to account for extreme GCcontent/temp/salinity:
```
$ prfect.py test/lambda.gbk -s 1.5 --dump | head -n 2
LOCUS      SLIPSITE   LOC  LABEL  N  DIR RBS1 RBS2  A0     A1     LF50    HK50    LF100   HK100  PRED  PROB  MOTIF

NC_001416  ggaaagtgt  10115  0   18  -1    2     0  0.004  0.024  -0.47   -0.431  -1.002  -0.606  -1  0.999  threethree  
```
you will notice that the MFE values were scaled by 50% when compared to the above dump, which also caused the trained model to be more confident in the backward -1 PREDiction at LOCation 10115
